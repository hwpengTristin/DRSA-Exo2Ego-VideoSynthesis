# DRSA-Exo2Ego-VideoSynthesis
For cue-free E2VG problem, we propose a cue-free video-based approach termed hierarchical Dynamic memory Refinement and Semantic Alignment (DRSA). Moreover, we create a new DSO ExoEgo dataset with dynamic exocentric scenes and rich interacting objects to advance the E2VG research.

## DSO ExoEgo Dataset

Some examples of scenarios and interacting objects from the DSO ExoEgo dataset. Zoom in for details.

Our dataset includes 819 exo-ego video pairs, totaling approximately 10.8 hours of episodes (totaling 2,328,054 frames), with videos varying in length from 270 to 5,101 frames as detailed in Figure. The dataset will be publicly released following the article's acceptance to facilitate the E2VG research.
